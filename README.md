# MAA-Z

MAA-Z is a project that aims to rebuild the MaaArknightsAssistant using Tauri and MAA Framework.

This project has another name in Greek, μαα, which will quite resemble the original project's name if you write them in uppercase which is ΜΑΑ(Note the difference though, they are greek letters!).

## Build

This project uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) to manifest the build process. You can use the following commands to build the project:

```bash
task build
```

For more complete commands, refer to the `Taskfile.yml` file.
